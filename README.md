# Lucene Index Upgrader
* This is a stand-alone Java application that upgrades Lucene indexes to version 8.8.1.
* It is based off the open source project [luceneupgrader](https://github.com/hakanai/luceneupgrader).
* For simplicity, I removed all tests related the code and converted the project into gradle project.
* You can change the [build.gradle](./build.gradle) file to specify the exact Lucene version
you would like to be upgraded to, for example 8.8.2 or 8.9.0.

## Usage
You need to have the following 3 jar files on the class path to run it.
* lucene-one-stop-index-upgrader-8.8.1.jar (generated by running gradle build from this project)
* lucene-backward-codecs-8.8.1.jar (downloadable from [Apache Lucene Archive site](https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/8.8.1/))
* lucene-core-8.8.1.jar (downloadable from [Apache Lucene Archive site](https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/8.8.1/))

#### Example on MacOS/Linux:
```
java -cp lucene-one-stop-index-upgrader-8.8.1.jar:lucene-backward-codecs-8.8.1.jar:lucene-core-8.8.1.jar ying.andrews.lucene.UpgradeTo8
```
#### Sample run to upgrade an old version 6 index to 8.8.1
```
You are about to upgrade an older lucene index to Version 8.8.1
